ðŸš€ Just wrapped up an exciting project! ðŸš€

I developed a dynamic cricket game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This project has not only deepened my understanding of web development but also allowed me to integrate interactive elements and game logic.
You can play against the computer, and it features real-time scoring, responsive design, and smooth animations. 
It was a fantastic opportunity to hone my skills and I'm thrilled with the outcome. Check it out and let me know what you think!
